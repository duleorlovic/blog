# Introduction

We can get lat/long pair from browser. If that fails than we can ask user for
address and geocode it on server
[Google Maps Geocoding API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geocoding/intro)
or on client [Google Maps Javascript
API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/geocoding)
Geocoding Service.

[Google Maps Geolocation
API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro#wifi_access_point_object)
can use wifi or tower ids to give you latLng.
