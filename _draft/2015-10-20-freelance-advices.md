You need to be different.
For example there was a job post:

**title:** Edits to a Ruby on Rails Website

**details:** Need a few small edits made to a simple website.

**Proposals:** 42

![freelance]({{ site.baseurl}}//assets/posts/freelance_job.jpg)

You will think, how to write nice proposal, how to show my experience and that I capable of doing *small edits to a simple website*.

My proposal was:

> I think its harder to read all those proposals than to make changed in Ruby on Rails application :)

(even a copy error changed -> changes)

And customer contacted me.
