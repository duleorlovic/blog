Virtual IT lab

Main mission to help organize your own code idea. For example when I implement
one feature in one project and than same thing on other project, than I improved
it in first project. Next time I want to implement that feature I want te be
able to find it easilly and last version.

Each example is pushed to our gitlab and new docker image is created and stored
to gitlab docker repository.

Based on Play with docker SDK

Here is example of tutorial and output panel
https://github.com/play-with-docker/play-with-docker.github.io
which is server under
https://training.play-with-docker.com
It just uses https://github.com/play-with-docker/sdk like
```
<html>
  <head>
    <title>PWD SDK</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <div id="myTerm" style="width: 500px; height: 500px;"></div>
    <link
      rel="stylesheet"
      href="https://unpkg.com/pwd-sdk@0.0.12/dist/styles.css"
    />
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/pwd-sdk@0.0.12/dist/pwd.min.js"></script>
    <script>
      pwd = new PWD();
      pwd.newSession([{ selector: "#myTerm" }], { baseUrl: 'http://localhost'});
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```
and inside docs you can use `.term1` to direct commands to terminal or
`data-term` to open server for current session

TRK samples

Code can be run on providers like Heroku, AWS, Google cloud.
Or locally with two commands:  `git clone ... && docker-compose up`
Normal visitors can see only the screenshots or static page.
Paid PRO membership can play with the code online using codeserver and preview
using play with docker (or similar).
Everything should be open and visible, registration only when necessary.
