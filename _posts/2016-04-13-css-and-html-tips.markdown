* when you want to have smaller input field type number you need to provide both
  `min` and `max`, like `<input type="number" min="0" max="99">`
* when you have some div/dt `float: left; width: 100px` than text can be on one
  line `white-space: nowrap;overflow: hidden;text-overflow: ellipsis;` or in
  multiple lines `white-space: normal`
