# Apps

Apps that does not have "Free plan available" can not be installed on test
stores. "Upgrade your account" will be shown for all apps that charges per month
or have 7-day free trial.

* https://apps.shopify.com/bookthatapp (Free plan available) add calendar and
  timeslots to your product/service so user can pick dates and it will be added
  as custom fields. Drawback is that "Buy now" button is visible and than in
  javascript it is replaced with "Add to cart" or "View Booking". They have nice
  reference sites https://pragmaticinsights.myshopify.com/pages/reference-sites
  (sup boards, inflatable jumpers, bike)
