# Esnext

https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features
https://medium.freecodecamp.org/es5-to-esnext-heres-every-feature-added-to-javascript-since-2015-d0c255e13c6e
https://blog.bitsrc.io/6-tricks-with-resting-and-spreading-javascript-objects-68d585bdc83

ES6 is ES2015, ES7 is published on 2016 and so on (latest is
ES#{curent_year%2010+(month > june) ? 1 : 0 }).
ES6 features:

* defining variable was using `var a` (in strict mode, which is default in ES6,
 error is raised for using undefined variables). If it was defined inside
 function, it was visible only inside it, otherwise global scope. It should be
 declarad at the beggining of a function, because it can be still referecenced
 before declaration and used like a function parameter (hoisting). ES6
 introduced `let` and `const` with *block scope*. For example inside `if ()
 { let myVar=1; }` (`myVar` is not accesible outside of `if` block). Also you
 can NOT use variable before we `let variable`. Also you can NOT redeclare same
 variable name (or if name is same as param declaration `function f(myName) {
 let myName; }`. Notice difference in

  ~~~
  for (var i = 1; i< 5; i++) {
    console.log(i)
    setTimeout(function() {
      console.log(i) # here we have i = 5,5,5,5 since same variable is used
      # if we used let i=1;i<5;i++ than it will be different variable: 1,2,3,4
    }, 1000)
  }
  ~~~
  `const MY_CONST = document.querySelect(".my-class");` have block scope,
  and it should be used for all non volatile variables. If you use object than
  nested values can change `const k = { a: 3 }; k.a = 4`

* interpolation of template literals with backticks and curly braces
  ~~~
  var name = "Duke";
  console.log(`Hello ${name}`);

  const multiLine = `this
  is
  multi
  line`

  // use trim() so you can go to new line at beggining
  let n = `
  hi
  bye`.trim()
  ~~~

* arrow functions are abbreviated syntax for anonymouse functions. If there is
 only one parameter than you can omit parenthesis, if there are no params than
 you can replace parenthesis with `_`.
 One liner syntax (without curly braces) use implicit return, for other you need
 explicit return if you need. If returning object, remember to wrap inside
 parethenses

  ~~~
  var sayHello = (name) => ({name: `Hello ${name}!`})
  var sayCiao = name => {
    return `Ciao ${name}!`
  }
  ~~~

* arrow functions automatically bind `this`
  ```
  class MyClass {
    regular() {
      return function() {
        console.log('regular this: ', this) // undefined
      }
    }
    arrow() {
      return () => {
        console.log('arrow this: ', this) // MyClass
      }
    }
  }
  ```
  Note that `this` inside arrow functions does not bind to current object for
  object methods. It binds to outer `this` (it is inherited from the execution
  context). So `this` is usefull only if you have function inside method that is
  defined in clasical way, ie do not use arrow functions for methods, use
  old functions (when dynamic context is not needed). Also for jQuery each
  `$.each(functions() {$(this).select2()})` use normal function instead of arrow
  function.

  ~~~
  let o = {
    name: 'name',
    myMethod: function() {
      setTimeout( () => {
        console.log(this.name) // o.name
      }, 3000)
    }
  }
  ~~~

* destructuring with default parameters values and renaming
  <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment>

  ~~~
  # destructuring arrays
  let [, month, date = 1] = '2010-10-11'.split('-')
  # month = '10' and date = '11'
  let [f, s, ...rest] = [1, 2, 3, 4]
  # f=1, s=2, rest = [3,4]

  # destructuring objects
  let { name, age, gender:sex = 'male' } = { name: 'Duke', age: '33', gender: 'male' }
  # is the same as
  let name = o.name
  let age = o.age
  let sex = o.gender # here we also renaming and have default value
  ~~~

  You can also use destructuring when defining methods

  ~~~
  function call({
    name: 'My Name',
    phone: '123123',
  } = {}) {
    console.log(name + ' ' + phone)
  }
  ~~~

  You can also destructure nested objects in function params

  ~~~
  var car = {
    model: 'bmw 2018',
    engine: {
      turbo: true,
      vin: 12345
    }
  }

  // es6 shorthand instead of
  // { vin: vin }
  // you can use just
  // { vin }
  const modelAndVIN = ({model, engine: {vin}}) => {
    console.log(`model: ${model} vin: ${vin}`);
  }

  modelAndVIN(car); // => model: bmw 2018  vin: 12345
  ~~~

  There exists rest `...` parameter which convers to array

  ~~~
  const sum = (...a) => a.reduce((sum, current) => sum + current, 0)
  ~~~

  and same operator `...` inside method call is called *spread* and it expands
  explode array to params (coffee calls this splats `f(items...)`)

  ~~~
  let a = [1, 2, 3]
  f(...a)
  # is the same as
  f(1, 2, 3)
  ~~~

  you can also spread objects `let d = { a: 3}; let db = { ...d, b: 3}`.
  But if object has methods, it wont be expanded.
  If you spread two objects, later will override: `let object1 = { a:1, b:2 };
  let object2 = { b:30, c:40}; let merged = {…object1, …object2} // {a:1, b:30,
  c:40}`.
  Merging nested properties you need to anotate each property when spreading
  untill you have one level object
  ```
  let a = { p: { x: 1 } }
  let b = { p: { y: 2 } }
  let m = { p: { ...a.p, ...b.p } }
  ```
  for default values you can use something like this so
  `passed.nested_parameter` does not override whole object `o.nested` but only
  properties of `o.nested`
  ```
  o = {
    parameter: 1,
    ...passed,
    nested: {
      nested_parameter: 2,
      ...passed.nested_parameter
    },
  }
  ```
  Note that is you have only `{ parameter: 1, ...passed }` than it will override
  whole `o.nested` with `passed.nested`.
  You can de-duplicate array with `let arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]; let deduped =
  [...new Set(arr)] // [1, 2, 3]`.

* default parameter values `function g(a=2){}`. It
can be combined with default destructing params `function g({a=1, b}={b:2}){}`
and `g({a: 2})` (ok b=2), `g()` (ok a=1, b=2), but `g({})` error, b is required.
* if you need some param to be required you can use this trick

  ~~~
  const required = () => {throw new Error('Missing parameter')};

  //The below function will trow an error if either "a" or "b" is missing.
  const add = (a = required(), b = required()) => a + b;

  add(1, 2) //3
  add(1) // Error: Missing parameter.
  ~~~

* `for(i=0;i<cars.length;i++) {}` is not concise `cars.forEach(myFunction)` is
  concise but can not break out of the loop. ES6 gives `for(let ... of ..) {}`
  (for values in array) and `for..in` (for object property names) is concise
  and can break. `for in` iterates over enumerable properties of an object in
  arbitrary order, `for of` iterates over values of iterable object. Use
  `.entries()` to get index
  ```
  for(let [i, car] of cars.entries()) { car }`

  for(let id in data) {
    let value = data[id]
  }
  ```

  To convert HtmlCollection to array you can use `Array.from(htmlCollection)`
  To create new array you can use `Array(9).fill(null)`.
* `array.reduce(function, init_value)` can be used as filtering if `init_value`
  is array, than function takes two arguments (init_value, array_item)
  ~~~
  const numbers = [10, 20, 30, 40];

  const doubledOver50 = numbers.reduce((finalList, num) => {
    num = num * 2; //double each number (i.e. map)
    //filter number > 50
    if (num > 50) {
      finalList.push(num);
    }
    return finalList;
  }, []);
  doubledOver50; // [60, 80]
  ~~~

* `class Person` can be used to instantiate objects `new Person()`. For
  initialization you can use `constructor(name) { this.name = name }`
  Instead of hash method `full_name: function() {}` we can write `full_name ()
  {}` This is shorthand for object method definitions
  https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Method_definitions
  I like to put space since it does not look like we are calling a function.

  Extend classes `class Employee extends Person {}` so we don't need to write
  `Employee.prototype = new Person` (or `var e = { __proto__: person }`.
  Inside `class` we can define instance and `static` methods. Static methods are
  called without instantiating their class (used for utility functions).
  Multiple inheritance can be achieved with mix-ins https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes#Mix-ins
  You can use getter (or setter) which binds an object property to a function
  that will be called when that property is looked up (or attempt to set that
  property `e.full_name =`)

  ~~~
  class Empoyee extends Person {
    constructor(name) {
      super(name);

      this.proffessional_name = name;
    }
    get full_name() {
      return this.name;
    }
    set full_name(name) {
      this.name = name;
    }

    static myUtilityFunction(uppercase) {
      return uppercase;
    }

    hello() {
      return `Hi, I'm ${name}`
    }
  }
  ~~~

* new data structure called `Map` and `WeakMap` (keys are objects, not plain
  values like number, string or symbol)

  ~~~
  var map = new Map();
  map.set('year', '123');
  map.get('year'); // '123'

  # or use initialization
  map = new Map([['color', 'red'],['owner', 'me']])
  # or
  map = new Map(Object.entries(object))
  # convert back to object
  object = Object.fromEntries(map)

  # some methods
  map.size
  map.keys()
  map.values()
  map.delete('color')
  map.clear()
  ~~~

* new data structure called `Set` and `WeakSet`
* new string functions
  `'asd'.startsWith('a');'asd'.endsWith('a');'asd'.includes('as');'a'.repeat(3);`
* new Array functions
  * `Array.from([1,2,3], x => x + x)`
  * `Array.find( user => user.age > 15)` same as `Array.findIndex` but returns
 object instead of index
   * `[1,2,3].filter( (n) => n > 2 )`
  * `[1,2].includes(3)` returns false

* property value shorthands, when you define object and you already have
variable with same name as key, you can use

  ~~~
  const name = 'dule'
  const anPerson = {
    name
  }
  // is the same as
  const aPerson = {
    name: name
  }
  ~~~

  it also exists for methods

  ~~~
  const aPerson = {
    speak (word) {},
    // same as
    speak: function (word) {},
    // do not use arrow because you can not access this
    // speak: () => {},
  }
  ~~~

* computed object property names (you can use variable as key)

  ~~~
  const name = 'dule'

  const aPerson = {
    'mile': 'value',
    [name]: 'dule is key and value', // same as 'dule': 'dule is key and value'
    [name+'car']: 'value', // { 'dulecar': 'value' }
  }
  ~~~

* generators
  ```
  function *calculator(input) {
    var doubleThat = 2 * (yield (input / 2))
    var another = yield (doubleThat)
    return (input * doubleThat * another)
  }
  ```

  ```
  const calc = calculator(10)
  // start
  > c.next()
  { value: 5, done: false }
  > c.next(7)
  { value: 14, done: false }
  > c.next(100)
  { value: 14000, done: true }
  ```

ES2017

* in function declarations and function calls you can use trailing commas
  `doSomething(p1, p2,)`

ES2019 ESNext

* `[1,[2, [3]]].flat(Infinity)`
* instead of `map` and `flat` you can use `flatMap`
  ```
  ['My dog', 'is awesome'].flatMap(words => words.split(' ')) 
  // [ 'My', 'dog', 'is', 'awesome' ]
  ```
* create object from entries `Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(person))` and
  usage is in transforming the objects
  ```
  const object = { x: 42, y: 50, abc: 9001 }
  const result = Object.fromEntries(
    Object.entries(object)
      .filter(([key, value]) => key.length === 1)
      .map(([key, value]) => [key, value * 2])
  )
  // { x: 84, y: 100 }
  ```

* class property can be marked as private with hash
  ```
  class Counter {
    #count = 0
    get value() {
      return this.#count
    }
    increment() {
      this.#count++
    }
  }

  const counter = new Counter()
  counter.#count // SyntaxError
  ```

* underscore in numbers: `1_000`.


# Promise

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises

Promise is an object representing eventual completion or failure of an
asynchronous operation.
We can use chaining to combine two callback function, so
`promise.then(callback1).then(callback2)` means than `callback1` will be
executed and than `callback2`.
`promise1 = promise.then(successCallback, failureCallback)` returns promise
which is completion of `promise` and `successCallback` or `failureCallback`
which also can be asynchronous functions returning a promise (in which case any
callbacks added to promise1 will be queued behind those promises returned by
`successCallback` or `failureCallback`).

If we attach handler to already settled promise, handler will be performed at
the first asynchronous opportunity (stack has cleared and clock tick has passed,
like `setTimeout(handler, 10)`).

`.catch(failureCallback)` is short-hand for `then(null, failureCallback)`.
Callback param is result of previous promise so using arrow functions
```
doSomething()
  .then(result => doSomethingElse(result))
  .then(elseResult => doThirdThing(newResult))
```

In `.catch().then()` if catch does not throw an error, `.then` will be performed

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise
a `Promise` is a proxy for a value not necessarily known when the promise is
created. It can be in one of three states: `pending` (initial), `fulfilled` or
`rejected`. When it is either `fulfilled` or `rejected` (also known as
`settled`) than all associated handlers queued up using `then` are called.
A promise is fulfilled if `promise.then(f)` will call `f` as soon as possible
A promise is rejected if `promise.then(null, r)` will call `r` as soon as
possible.
A promise is pending if it is neither fulfilled nor rejected.

https://github.com/domenic/promises-unwrapping/blob/master/docs/states-and-fates.md
Promises have two exclusive fates: resolved (when trying to resolve or reject it
has no effect on promise) and unresolved.

Signature of handler functions are simple, they accept a single parameter of any
type and termination condition determines the settled state of next promise in
the chain. Termination with `throw nextReason` creates a rejected state, other
termination, for example `return nextValue` creates resolved state. If nextValue
is another promise object, it is dynamically inserted into the chain. In this
case it is `resolved` but still is not `settled`.

Creating a new promise
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/Promise
`new Promise(executor)` constructor is used to wrap functions that do not
already support promises (like setTimeout, XMLHttpRequest). Argument `executor`
is function that accepts two functions `function(resolutionFunc, rejectionFunc)
{}` which we use in callbacks (in setTimeout or XMLHttpRequest.onload) which are
tethered to the promiseObj. Return value is not important, side effect is that
promiseObj is resolved and output is communicated by calling resolutionFunc or
rejectionFunc.

```
const promiseObj = new Promise((resolutionFunc, rejectionFunc) => {
  try {
    setTimeout(() => {
      resolutionFunc('foo')
    }, 300)
  }
  catch(err) {
    rejectionFunc('bar')
  }
})
```
Here is example of function which returns a promise
```
function myAsyncFunction(url) {
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest()
    xhr.open("GET", url)
    xhr.onload = () => resolve(xhr.responseText)
    xhr.onerror = () => reject(xhr.statusText)
    xhr.send()
  });
}
```

https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Promise/then
When return value of handler is some value, the promise returned by `.then()`
gets resolved with returned values as its value
When handler throes an error, promise returned by `.then()` gets rejected with
the thrown error as its value
When it returns another promise (fulfilled, rejected or pending) than promise
returned by `.then()` gets fulfilled, rejected or is in pending state.


`Promise.all([p1, p2]).then` will be executed when all are resolved
`Promise.race([p1, p2]).then` will be executed when first (any) is resolved
Both of this methods will be rejected if some of p1 is rejected - reject early.

`await Promise.allSettled([p1, p2])` all are finished (some failed or
succeeded).
`Promise.any([p1, p2])` is similar to `race` but does not reject early when one
of the promises rejects. We end up in `catch` block when all were rejected.

Async/Await
```
const doSomethingAsync = () => {
  return new Promise(resolve => {
    setTimeout( () => resolve('Here is thing I built after some delay'), 2000);
  })
}

const doSomething = async () => {
  console.log(await doSomethingAsync())
}
```

Using `async` to a function means that it will return promise, so those two
functions are the same:
```
const aFunction = async () => {
  return 'test'
}

const aFunction = () => {
  return Promise.resolve('test')
}

aFunction().then(console.log)
```

ES2018 there is `for await (const line of readLines(filePath)) { log(line) }`

`.finnaly()` is executed regardless of the successful or not promise.


# Modules

Import bindings which are exported by another module (js file). Module is just
js script (no need for special keyword) but everything defined inside module is
local to the module, except when you use `export`.
<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/import>

~~~
function myModule() {
  this.hello = function() {
    return 'hello
  }
}

module.exports = myModule
~~~

Note that for Webpack you can use CommonJS module and use with `require`

~~~
var myModule = require('myModule');

var myModuleInstance = new myModule();
myModuleInstance.hello(); // 'hello!'
~~~

Using Asynchronous Module Definition AMD can load modules async using `define`

~~~
define(['myModule', 'myOtherModule'], function(myModule, myOtherModule) {
  console.log(myModule.hello());
});
~~~

Universal Module Definition UMD combines AMD and CommonJS. But ECMASCRIPT 6
introduce `import` and `export` methods which replace all those functions...
So if you write libs for web you should create all variations so it can be
used in webpack or directly
https://medium.com/@kelin2025/so-you-wanna-use-es6-modules-714f48b3a953

You can export any top level function, class, var, let or const.

~~~
// lim/math.js
export function sum(x, y) {
  return x + y;
}

// you could use export list
export { sum, pi };

// but the best is to use export multiple times
export CONST PI = 3.141593
export CONST MY_KEY = '3.141593'
~~~

You can name the export as `default` and in this case you can use anonymous
functions (otherwise you have to name each export so it can be distinquished
from other exports). In case export is default than you can import only one
item.

~~~
let myObject = {
  field1: value1,
  field2: value2
};
export {myObject as default};
// or better use shorthand
export default myObject
~~~

For index files you can export each file
```
// interfaces/index.ts
export * from './person.interface'
export * from './sport.interface'
```
and import all in one line
```
import { Person, Sport } from './interfaces/index'
```

Note that with `import` you should use curly brackets if there is no default
export, and check that you used correct variable name (same as in the `export`
command).
Note that when using webpack, when `export default sum` than you need to call
`const myModule = require('my_module'); myModule.default.sum()`
https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/web/javascript/reference/statements/export
Default import

```
// import what is default exported and bind bind to defaultExport
import defaultExport from "module-name";
// this is shorthand of
import { default as defaultExport } from 'module-name';
```

Namespace import
```
import * as name from "module-name";
```
Named import
```
import { export1 , export2 as alias2 , [...] } from 'module-name'
```
combination of default import and named or namespaces import
```
import defaultExport, { export [ , [...] ] } from "module-name";
import defaultExport, * as name from "module-name";
// just run the code, not importing anything
import "module-name";
```

module-name is relative (`./lib/math` or `lib/math`) or absolute path name to
the `.js` file
~~~
import * as math from "lib/math";
console.log("2pi = " + math.sum(math.pi, math.pi));

// or we could
import { pi, sum } from "lib/math";
console.log("2pi = " + sum(pi, pi));
~~~

In html you can include using script tag with `type='module'`
```
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8"/>
    <script type='module' src='./app.js'></script>
  </head>
  <body>
    asd up is
    <span id='up'></span>
  </body>
</html>

# app.js
import toUp from './t.js'
document.getElementById('up').innerHTML = toUp('asd')

# t.js
export default (str) => str.toUpperCase()
```

# NPM package

`-D` is shorthand for `--safe-dev`.

```
npm i -D @babel/core babel-loader webpack webpack-cli eslint-loader
```

# DOM

* instead of `element.dataset('activateTarget')` camelCase, we can use
  `element.getAttribute('data-activate-target')` snake case.
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementsByClassNamefinding 
  `getElementsByClassName('class)')` returns live `HTMLCollections` (similar to
  array, and it is updated when document is changed)
* https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/querySelectorAll
  `const elements = document.querySelectorAll(".class");`
  returns static `NodeList` (which provides `.entries()` and `.forEach()`). To
  convert to array you can use `Array.from(elements)` or `Array(...elements)`.

# Tips

* `arguments` object contains function arguments, but better is to use
  `...arguments` as rest parameter
* one liner if statement `if (text.lenth == 0) return`
* jquery `$(selector).addClass('b')` can be written as
  `element.classList.add('b')` or `elements.forEach((element) =>
  element.classList.add('b') )`. Also for `toggle` and `remove`. other
  examples http://youmightnotneedjquery.com/
* string substring `str.substring(1, str.length(-2))` can be replaced with slice
  `str.slice(1, -2)`
