Let me see is a web app that you can run locally (or self hosted somewhere) and
use to test how some webpage looks like.
Note that you need permission to access that page.
It is simillar to other testing, scrapping, crawler tools, but I wanted to build
one myself.

It is API based service.

Results can be returned using websockets:
