# Usage

https://tailwindcss.com/docs/responsive-design/
Responsive design uses 4 breakpoints
* `@media (min-width: 640px)` small `sm`
* `@media (min-width: 768px)` medium `md`
* `@media (min-width: 1024px)` large `lg`
* `@media (min-width: 1280px)` extra large `xl`

Use prefix like `md:` to apply on that screensize. Default is mobile size so do
not use prefix `sm:`.

Use prefix `hover:` to apply a utility on hover
